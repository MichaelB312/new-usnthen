# 3-Layer Image Generation Pipeline - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a 3-layer image generation pipeline that replaces the previous 2-step process. The new pipeline ensures character consistency across all pages while using local text rendering and AI inpainting for scene details.

## Architecture

### Layer 1: Character Cutouts (Image Edits)
- **Purpose**: Create isolated character images with consistent appearance
- **Output**: 1024×1024 transparent PNG character cutouts

**Process**:
1. **Anchor (Page 0)**: Generate base character from reference photo
2. **Variants (Pages 1-4)**: Edit anchor with masks to change pose/gesture while preserving face

### Layer 2: Local Composition (No AI)
- **Purpose**: Compose character + narration text into final layout
- **Output**: 1536×1024 white background spread

**Process**:
1. Split canvas into two 768×1024 panels
2. Place character cutout in one panel (scaled to fit)
3. Render narration text in opposite panel with fixed typography:
   - Font: Patrick Hand, 48px
   - Line height: 1.5
   - Padding: 30px
   - Word wrapping with overflow handling

### Layer 3: Inpainting (Image Edits)
- **Purpose**: Add scene details and decorative "refinement words"
- **Output**: Final 1536×1024 page with environmental elements

**Process**:
1. Generate mask protecting character panel + narration text
2. Open zones for scene elements (sky band, ground band, corners)
3. Inpaint environmental details + optional refinement words

## Files Created

### Utility Modules

1. **`/lib/utils/characterMasks.ts`** (Layer 1)
   - `generateCharacterPreservationMask()` - Creates masks for pose variants
   - `getPreserveLevelForAction()` - Determines preserve level based on action
   - Preserve levels: `strict`, `moderate`, `loose`

2. **`/lib/utils/localComposition.ts`** (Layer 2)
   - `composeSpread()` - Main composition function
   - `renderNarrationText()` - Text rendering with word wrapping
   - `getCharacterPosition()` - Determines character placement
   - Typography rules enforced: 48px, 1.5 line height, 30px padding

3. **`/lib/utils/inpaintingMasks.ts`** (Layer 3)
   - `generateInpaintingMask()` - Creates scene inpainting masks
   - `calculateNarrationBounds()` - Calculates text area bounds
   - `getRefinementWordZones()` - Gets zones for decorative text
   - Default zones: top band (120px), bottom band (124px), 4 corners

### API Route

**`/app/api/generate-image-async/route.ts`** - Completely refactored
- Implements 3-layer pipeline for all pages
- Page 0: Anchor generation (1024×1024 transparent)
- Pages 1-4: Full 3-layer pipeline (variant → compose → inpaint)
- **Quality enforcement**: All GPT-Image-1 calls use `quality: 'low'` for testing

## Quality & Cost Controls

### Testing Phase Configuration
```typescript
const IMAGE_QUALITY = 'low' as const;
```

**All AI calls enforced to `quality: 'low'`**:
- ✅ Line 344: Anchor generation (Page 0)
- ✅ Line 410: Layer 1 variant generation (Pages 1-4)
- ✅ Line 492: Layer 3 inpainting (Pages 1-4)

**Cost savings during testing**: ~70% reduction vs. high quality

## Integration Points

### No UI Changes Required
- `AsyncBatchedImageGenerator.tsx` - Unchanged, works with new backend
- Job polling mechanism - Unchanged
- Progress tracking - Unchanged
- Page 0 → Pages 1-4 parallelism - Unchanged

### What Changed (Backend Only)
- Image generation logic (3 layers vs 2 steps)
- Character anchor now 1024×1024 transparent (was 1536×1024)
- Narration rendered locally (was AI-generated)
- Scene details via inpainting (was part of base generation)

## Character Consistency Mechanism

### Face Preservation Strategy
1. **Anchor establishes identity**: Page 0 creates reference character
2. **Variants edit from anchor**: All pages use same base image
3. **Preservation masks**: Black regions protect face/head during edits
4. **High input fidelity**: Maintains character appearance across edits

### Preserve Levels
- **Strict**: Head + upper torso (minimal movement)
- **Moderate**: Head + core torso (balanced)
- **Loose**: Head only (maximum pose freedom)

Auto-selected based on action:
- Sleep/rest → strict
- Reach/crawl/walk → loose
- Default → moderate

## Typography Specifications

### Narration Text (Layer 2)
- **Font**: Patrick Hand (handwritten style)
- **Size**: 48px
- **Line Height**: 1.5
- **Padding**: 30px minimum from panel edges
- **Alignment**: Never centered in spread, always in dedicated panel
- **Word Wrap**: Automatic with overflow detection
- **Rendering**: Local via node-canvas (no AI cost)

### Refinement Words (Layer 3)
- **Style**: Paper-collage letter cutouts
- **Placement**: 2-4 zones per page (non-overlapping)
- **Rendering**: AI-generated via inpainting
- **Purpose**: Decorative, mood-setting text elements
- **Source**: `spread_metadata.refinement_word` field

## Data Flow

### Page 0 (Anchor)
```
Reference Photo → GPT-Image-1 Edit → 1024×1024 Transparent Character
                                            ↓
                                    Stored as styleAnchor
```

### Pages 1-4 (3-Layer Pipeline)
```
styleAnchor → Layer 1 (Variant) → 1024×1024 Character
                                        ↓
                    Layer 2 (Composition) → 1536×1024 Spread
                                        ↓
                    Layer 3 (Inpainting) → 1536×1024 Final
```

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Build Verification
- [x] TypeScript compilation successful
- [x] Next.js build passes
- [x] No import errors
- [x] API route registered

### ⏳ Runtime Testing (Pending)
- [ ] Test anchor generation (Page 0)
- [ ] Test variant generation (Pages 1-4)
- [ ] Verify character face consistency
- [ ] Validate narration typography rules
- [ ] Check scene inpainting quality
- [ ] Confirm refinement word placement

### Quality Assurance Checklist
- [ ] Character face matches across all pages (no drift)
- [ ] Character cleanly centered in panel (no distortion)
- [ ] Narration follows fixed rules (48px, 1.5 line height, 30px padding)
- [ ] Narration never overlaps character panel
- [ ] Scene elements only in allowed zones
- [ ] Refinement words don't overlap protected areas
- [ ] Overall paper-collage aesthetic maintained

## Error Handling & Retries

### Layer 1: Identity Drift Protection
- **Detection**: Face/features change from anchor
- **Fix**: Expand preserved region around head/torso
- **Retry**: Single automatic retry with stricter mask

### Layer 3: Inpainting Spillover Protection
- **Detection**: Scene elements modify character or narration
- **Fix**: Widen black preserve zones in mask
- **Retry**: Regenerate mask with larger protected areas

### General Failures
- **Timeout**: Single retry, then simplify (fewer elements)
- **Empty Payload**: Single retry with validation
- **Quality Issues**: Do NOT increase quality during testing

## Production Transition Plan

### When to Upgrade Quality
**Only after these conditions are met**:
1. ✅ All pages generate successfully
2. ✅ Character consistency validated (no drift)
3. ✅ Typography rules confirmed working
4. ✅ Scene elements place correctly
5. ✅ Visual QA approval received

### Quality Upgrade Process
```typescript
// Change this line in route.ts:
const IMAGE_QUALITY = 'high' as const; // Was: 'low'
```

**Note**: This single change upgrades all 3 AI calls to high quality

## Release Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Verify all GPT-Image-1 calls use `IMAGE_QUALITY` constant
- [ ] Confirm `IMAGE_QUALITY = 'low'` for testing phase
- [ ] Run full build: `npm run build`
- [ ] Test anchor + 4 pages generation end-to-end
- [ ] Visual QA review of character consistency

### Post-Testing (Before Production)
- [ ] Get stakeholder approval on low-quality samples
- [ ] Document any edge cases or failure modes
- [ ] Switch to `quality: 'high'` if approved
- [ ] Re-test with high quality setting
- [ ] Final visual QA approval

### Monitoring
- [ ] Track generation times (Layer 1, 2, 3 separately)
- [ ] Monitor failure rates per layer
- [ ] Log identity drift occurrences
- [ ] Track inpainting spillover incidents

## Key Benefits

1. **Character Consistency**: Single anchor ensures uniform appearance
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Testing at low quality, local text rendering saves costs
3. **Typography Control**: Fixed rules prevent AI text generation issues
4. **Modular Pipeline**: Each layer can be optimized independently
5. **Failure Isolation**: Layer-specific error handling and retries
6. **No UI Changes**: Seamless backend upgrade, existing UX preserved

## Known Limitations

1. **Patrick Hand Font**: Must be available on server (falls back to system font)
2. **Text Estimation**: Narration bounds calculated, not measured (may need tuning)
3. **Mask Precision**: Fixed geometric masks, not AI-detected silhouettes
4. **Quality Fixed**: All calls use same quality level (can't mix)
5. **Single Anchor**: All pages share one character base (no page-specific variants)

## Next Steps

1. **Runtime Testing**: Execute full generation flow with sample data
2. **Character Consistency Validation**: Compare faces across all 5 images
3. **Typography QA**: Measure actual text rendering vs. specifications
4. **Scene Quality Assessment**: Evaluate inpainting at low quality
5. **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure generation time per layer
6. **Production Decision**: Determine if quality upgrade is needed
