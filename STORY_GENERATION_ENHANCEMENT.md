# Story Generation Enhancement Documentation

## Overview

The story generation system has been completely redesigned using **master prompt principles** for children's book authoring. This creates significantly higher quality, age-appropriate, emotionally resonant stories that follow professional children's book writing standards.

## What Changed

### Before: Basic Story Generation
- Generic prompts with simple guidelines
- Inconsistent age adaptation
- Emotions stated flatly ("She was happy")
- Limited narrative structure
- Basic word count limits

### After: Master Prompt System
- Professional children's book author principles
- Precise age-specific adaptation (0-2, 2-4, 4-6 years)
- "Show don't tell" emotional writing
- Complete narrative arcs (setup → action → resolution)
- Strict word count validation with total story limits
- Sensory-rich, immersive storytelling

## Key Improvements

### 1. Age-Specific Adaptation

#### 0-2 Years (Infant/Toddler)
**Word Count:** 50-200 total, 3-12 per page
**Focus:** Rhythm, repetition, naming the world
**Language:**
- Simple declarative sentences
- Heavy onomatopoeia (SPLASH! SWOOSH!)
- Repetitive phrases
- Sensory naming
- No complex problems

**Example:**
```
Yara's toes wiggle in the warm sand. Wiggle, wiggle!
Down she sits. PLOP!
What's that sound? SWOOSH! SWOOSH!
It's the big, blue waves!
```

#### 2-4 Years (Preschooler)
**Word Count:** 200-600 total, 15-30 per page
**Focus:** Emotional journey with simple problem-resolution
**Language:**
- Mix of simple and compound sentences
- Simple natural dialogue
- Action verbs (reached, grabbed, splashed)
- Show emotions through actions
- 3-act structure (setup → challenge → resolution)

**Example:**
```
Yara stared at the big waves. They looked... scary.
'It's okay, sweetie,' Mama whispered. 'I'm right here.'
Yara took one tiny step. Then another.
SPLASH! The water tickled her toes!
She looked up at Mama and giggled. 'Again! Again!'
```

#### 4-6 Years (Kindergartener)
**Word Count:** 500-1000 total, 25-50 per page
**Focus:** Discovery, growth, family bonds
**Language:**
- Varied sentence structures
- Robust vocabulary (brave, determined, magnificent)
- Natural dialogue revealing character
- Sparse metaphors/similes
- Complete narrative arc with character development

**Example:**
```
Yara stood at the edge of the beach, her eyes wide as saucers.
The ocean stretched out before her, bigger than anything she'd ever seen.
'You ready, sweetheart?' Dad asked, his hand warm in hers.
Yara took a deep breath. She wasn't sure, but... she wanted to be brave.
'Let's do it!' she declared, squeezing Dad's hand tight.
Together, they stepped forward. And when that first wave washed over her feet,
Yara's surprised laugh rang out across the beach.
```

### 2. Show Don't Tell Emotions

**Old Approach:**
```
❌ "She was happy."
❌ "He felt scared."
❌ "They were excited."
```

**New Approach:**
```
✅ "A giant smile spread across Yara's face, and she let out a happy giggle."
✅ "Yara stopped. His eyes grew wide, and he reached for Daddy's hand."
✅ "Yara bounced on her toes, her eyes sparkling with anticipation."
```

### 3. Narrative Structure

Stories now follow proper narrative arcs:

**4-Page Stories:**
- Pages 1-2: Setup (scene, characters, anticipation)
- Page 3: Action (main event, challenge with family support)
- Page 4: Conclusion (warm resolution)

**8-12 Page Stories:**
- Pages 1-3: Setup (introduce scene and build wonder)
- Pages 4-7: Discovery & Action (main events, challenges overcome)
- Pages 8-12: Sweet Conclusion (emotional satisfaction, lesson learned)

### 4. Emotional Core as "North Star"

Every page connects back to the central emotion:
- Identified from parent's "why special" answer
- Woven throughout the narrative
- Reinforced in each scene
- Creates emotional cohesion

### 5. Sensory Immersion

Rich sensory details create vivid worlds:
- Visual: Colors, movements, expressions
- Auditory: Onomatopoeia, sounds in UPPERCASE
- Tactile: Textures, temperatures
- From parent's sensory details answer

### 6. Point of View & Tense

**Consistent throughout:**
- Third-person limited (focus on child's experience)
- Past tense for classic storytelling
- Reader feels present in the moment
- Warm, loving, reassuring tone

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Word Limits

```typescript
function getWordLimit(ageInMonths: number) {
  if (ageInMonths < 6)
    return { min: 3, max: 8, total: { min: 50, max: 100 } };
  if (ageInMonths < 12)
    return { min: 5, max: 12, total: { min: 75, max: 150 } };
  if (ageInMonths < 24)
    return { min: 8, max: 15, total: { min: 100, max: 200 } };
  if (ageInMonths < 48)
    return { min: 15, max: 30, total: { min: 200, max: 600 } };
  return { min: 25, max: 50, total: { min: 500, max: 1000 } };
}
```

### Word Count Validation

The system now validates:
- **Per-page word counts** against age limits
- **Total story word counts** with warnings
- Logs deviations to help improve prompts

```typescript
// Total story validation
const totalWords = storyData.pages.reduce((sum, page) => {
  return sum + page.narration.split(/\s+/).length;
}, 0);

if (totalWords < wordLimits.total.min * 0.8 ||
    totalWords > wordLimits.total.max * 1.2) {
  console.warn(`Story word count outside range`);
}

// Per-page validation
const pageWordCount = page.narration.split(/\s+/).length;
if (pageWordCount < wordLimits.min || pageWordCount > wordLimits.max) {
  console.warn(`Page ${index + 1} word count outside range`);
}
```

### Master Prompt Structure

```typescript
const prompt = `You are an expert children's book author...

## Examples of Improvements

### Old Output (Generic)
```
Yara went to the beach. She was happy.
The water was nice. She played with Mom.
It was fun. They went home.
```

### New Output (Master Prompt)
**For 2-4 Year Old:**
```
Yara's toes touched the warm, golden sand.
"Ooh!" she giggled, wiggling them deeper.

Ahead, the big blue waves went SWOOSH, SWOOSH.
Yara stopped. They looked... so big.

Mama knelt beside her. "Want to try together?"
she whispered, holding out her hand.

Yara's fingers wrapped tight around Mama's.
One step. Two steps. Three!

SPLASH! The water tickled her feet!
Yara's surprised laugh bubbled up, bright and joyful.
"Again, Mama! Again!"
```

## Backward Compatibility

All changes maintain compatibility:
- Same JSON output structure
- Camera angles preserved
- Character assignment unchanged
- Spread sequences still work
- Image generation unaffected
- Layout engine compatible

The `narration` and `visual_action` fields now contain higher quality content following master prompt principles.

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Create a new book at `/create`
3. Complete the conversation
4. Review generated story quality
5. Check console for word count logs
6. Verify age-appropriate language
7. Confirm emotions are shown, not told

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add story quality scoring
