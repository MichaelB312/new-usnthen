# Changelog - October 31, 2025

## Major Changes: AI-Powered Guide System & Documentation Organization

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Conversation System (3.0 Enhancement)

Replaced static pre-defined questions with a real AI-powered guide system using Gemini Pro.

#### What Changed

**Before:**
- Static, pre-defined questions from arrays
- Generic, robotic conversation flow
- No context awareness
- Scripted follow-ups
- Finished conversations prematurely

**After:**
- Dynamic AI-powered conversations using Gemini Pro
- Natural, contextual questions based on previous answers
- Intelligent follow-up questions
- Automatic structured data extraction
- Comprehensive validation ensures complete stories

#### New Components

**1. BookTypeDirector** (`lib/agents/BookTypeDirector.ts`)
- Manages conversation state for each book type
- Tracks required fields and completion status
- Provides AI with contextual prompts
- Validates story completeness
- Supports all 5 book types with specific schemas

**2. AI Conversation API** (`/api/guide-conversation`)
- Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp model
- Natural language understanding
- Extracts structured data from free-form responses
- Generates contextual next questions
- Handles conversation flow intelligently

**3. Updated HybridChatInterface**
- Now calls AI-powered API instead of static GuideAgent
- Passes bookType and writingStyle to inform AI
- Displays clean progress bar
- Saves structured data to store when complete

#### Comprehensive Validation by Book Type

**Growth Story (Milestone Journey):**
- Requires: beginning (30+ chars), middle_journey (2+ items), breakthrough (50+ chars), afterglow (30+ chars)
- Won't finish until complete journey arc is collected
- Example: First steps story needs crawling ‚Üí standing ‚Üí THE WALKING MOMENT ‚Üí how things are now

**Special Moment (Single Memory):**
- Requires: when/where, what_happened (2+ parts), sensory_details (30+ chars), why_special (30+ chars)
- Won't finish until full event sequence is described
- Example: Beach story needs setup ‚Üí full sequence ‚Üí sensory details ‚Üí emotional significance

**Tribute Book (Gift for Someone):**
- Requires: recipient, relationship, reasons_to_love (3+ items), shared_memory (50+ chars), special_wish (30+ chars)
- Won't finish until multiple specific reasons are given
- Example: Grandma tribute needs at least 3-4 reasons with details

**Special World (Everyday Environment):**
- Requires: world_theme, daily_walk_sights (3+ items), favorite_sounds (2+ items), cozy_routine (30+ chars)
- Won't finish until vivid world picture is complete
- Example: Neighborhood story needs 3-4 sights + 2-3 sounds + routine

**Guided Template:**
- Standard validation (less strict)

#### Technical Improvements

**Stricter Validation:**
```typescript
// Strings need substantial content (30+ chars minimum)
// Arrays need 2+ items or 1 detailed item (50+ chars)
// Critical fields like breakthrough need 50+ chars
```

**Smart Data Updates:**
- Only keeps longer/more detailed responses
- Appends to arrays instead of replacing
- Validates at multiple checkpoints

**Gemini Chat History Fix:**
- Fixed: "First content should be with role 'user'" error
- Filters conversation history to ensure proper format
- Maintains context while meeting API requirements

**Removed Confusing Elements:**
- Removed "helpers" field from Growth Story schema
- Hidden technical field labels from progress bar
- Cleaner, user-friendly interface

#### AI System Prompts

Each book type receives specific guidance:
- Book type description and goals
- Required field schemas with descriptions
- What's already collected vs. what's needed
- Instructions for natural, patient conversation
- Critical requirements (e.g., "DO NOT finish until you have ALL 4 parts")

#### Benefits

‚úÖ Natural, engaging conversations (not robotic Q&A)
‚úÖ Context-aware follow-up questions
‚úÖ Collects complete, rich stories (not premature endings)
‚úÖ Works across all 6 languages
‚úÖ Validates story completeness automatically
‚úÖ Extracts structured data while maintaining natural flow
‚úÖ User's actual story is used (not made-up content)
