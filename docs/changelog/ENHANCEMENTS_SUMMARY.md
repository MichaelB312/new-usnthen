**Key Features:**
- Natural, context-aware questions
- Combines multiple fields into single questions
- Extracts structured data from free-form responses
- Visual progress tracking with completion percentage
- Seamless conversion to legacy format for story generation

**Files Created:**
- `lib/agents/StoryMemoryDirector.ts`
- `app/api/story-conversation/route.ts`
- `lib/agents/conversationAdapter.ts`
- `components/story-wizard/HybridChatInterface.tsx`
- `HYBRID_AGENT_SYSTEM.md` (full docs)

**How to Enable:**
```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_HYBRID_AGENT=true  # Already enabled by default
```

### 2. 📚 Master Prompt Story Generation
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Ready

Completely redesigned story generation using professional children's book authoring principles.

**Key Improvements:**

#### Age-Specific Adaptation

## Before vs. After Comparison

### Conversation Experience

**Before (Old Question Tree):**
```
❌ Wizard: What special memory would you like to capture?
   User: Her first time at the beach with me and her Dad
❌ Wizard: Where did this happen?
   User: At the beach
❌ Wizard: Who was there with Yara?
   User: Me and her Dad
```

**After (Hybrid Agent):**
```
✅ Wizard: To begin, just tell me about the moment you're thinking of -
          what happened, where were you, and who was there with Yara?
   User: Her first time at the beach with me and her Dad

   [AI extracts all three fields from one response!]

✅ Wizard: What a precious first! I can picture Yara at the beach with
          you both. How did this special moment begin?
```

### Story Quality

**Before (Generic):**
```
❌ Yara went to the beach. She was happy.
   The water was nice. She played with Mom.
   It was fun. They went home.
```

**After (Master Prompt):**
```
✅ Yara's toes touched the warm, golden sand.
   "Ooh!" she giggled, wiggling them deeper.

   Ahead, the big blue waves went SWOOSH, SWOOSH.
   Yara stopped. They looked... so big.

   Mama knelt beside her. "Want to try together?"
   she whispered, holding out her hand.

   Yara's fingers wrapped tight around Mama's.
   One step. Two steps. Three!

   SPLASH! The water tickled her feet!
   Yara's surprised laugh bubbled up, bright and joyful.
   "Again, Mama! Again!"
```
